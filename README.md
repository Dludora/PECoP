# PECoP: Parameter Efficient Continual Pretraining for Action Quality Assessment

## PD4T Dataset 


![PD4T](https://github.com/Plrbear/PECoP/assets/31938815/80ba7e89-72be-4353-b933-1659773c9fdb)


PD4T is a Parkinsonâ€™s disease dataset for human action quality assessment. videos were recorded using a single RGB camera from 30 PD patients performed four different PD tasks including gait (426 videos), hand movement (848 videos), finger tapping (806 videos), and leg agility (851 videos) in clinical settings.
The trained rater assigned a score for each task, based on the protocols of UPDRS, varying between 0 and 4 depending on the level of severity.

## Pretraining via PECoP 
### Requirements
- pytroch >= 1.3.0
- tensorboardX
- cv2
- scipy



### Pretraining
The Kinetics pretrained I3D downloaded from the reposity [kinetics_i3d_pytorch](https://github.com/hassony2/kinetics_i3d_pytorch/blob/master/model/model_rgb.pth)

To train I3D model using PECoP, update the paths for the Kinetics dataset and your data directory accordingly. Then, execute the following command:

python train.py --bs 16 --lr 0.001 --height 256 --width 256 --crop_sz 224 --clip_len 32



### Evaluation
Will be updaated...
